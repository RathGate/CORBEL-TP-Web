## Specifications

The game has been tested mainly in Google Chrome, but also in Firefox, Edge and Opera.
As all browser do not 'display' the sound effects the same way, you'll have to hit the "play" button in order to listen to the soundstrack, on each page.

You should also be able to play the game on smartphone !

Some more features should be added in the future (local storage and flag handling for example, both things that were a little bit too much for the exercise but that I still want to include at some point).

Anyways, enjoy !
